      <h4 class="name">Richard A. Rinaldi</h4>
      <h5 class="comp">President, ORA Consulting</h5>
      <p>I had the good fortune of working with Trey as a litigator on a protracted lawsuit. During, often trying periods, I found Trey to have excellent verbal skills and the ability to reduce complex legal issues into basic, understandable terms. Watching him at trial virtually destruct an opponent’s credibility was like watching sheer artistry at work. Through his efforts we won a significant financial award.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="test">
      <h4 class="name">Kathleen Ritz</h4>
      <h5 class="comp">CEO, Ritz Marketing, Inc.</h5>
      <p>For over 10 years, Trey has given me strategic and practical advice (albeit sometimes stern and unwanted) and always steers me in the direction of my best interests. He has guided me through some of the toughest situations I’ve ever faced, without losing patience or vigilance, and always takes the time to explain his advice. Every phone call and email has been promptly and personally returned with concern, regardless of the time or importance of the matter. The best description I can give of Trey is that he is genuine, professional, and truly cares about every single client he represents. Simply put, attorneys like Trey are exceptionally rare. He will be my counselor and friend for life, and I hope that others will get to experience his care and expertise.</p>

Not only does Mr. Lindley offer a vast wealth of substantive knowledge and experience, I have found him to be extremely efficient and cost-effective.

I would not hesitate to use Mr. Lindley for other matters requiring North Carolina counsel.</p>
