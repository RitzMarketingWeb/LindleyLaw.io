        <h2>Biography</h2> <br><br>
        <p>Trey’s family relocated from his birthplace, Richmond, VA, to Charlotte, NC shortly after his sixth birthday. Although he likes to tell people he decided to become a lawyer at age twelve, the inspiration probably sparked much earlier. In furtherance of that goal, he pursued activities intended to hone his skills as an orator and rhetorician. <br><br>

        Trey was Co-Captain of his high school’s debate team, and he typically placed in every tournament in which he competed, winning first place one year at the state championship tournament. <br><br>

        After graduating from high school in Charlotte, Trey attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Still focused on attending law school and becoming a litigator, he pursued degrees in philosophy (with a focus on the ethicists) and political science. Despite majoring in two of the more rigorous disciplines, he graduated with Highest Distinction (ranking in the top three percent of (3%) of his class) and was inducted as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. During college he served as a member of Student Congress and the Undergraduate Honor Court. <br><br>

        Trey spent the year following college in Washington, D.C. where he worked as a paralegal for the largest D.C.-based law firm before returning to Chapel Hill for law school. During law school, Trey served on the Attorney General’s Staff for the law school’s Honor Court and was a member of the North Carolina Law Review. Upon graduating with Honors and passing the bar in 2003, Trey returned to Charlotte where he has practiced civil litigation ever since. For the past five years in a row, Trey was named a Rising Star in Business Litigation by North Carolina Super Lawyer’s Magazine. He was named a Rising Star in Trust and Estate Litigation and a Super Lawyer in 2018.. These honors are awarded to fewer than two and one-half percent (2.5%) of all lawyers across the State of North Carolina. In February 2014, the Charlotte Business Journal named Trey to their Top 40 Under 40 list which recognizes the top business leaders under the age of 40 in the Charlotte region. <br><br>

        With over a decade of experience and after becoming a partner in another firm, Trey organized Lindley Law, PLLC in July 2014. Trey’s office is conveniently located at 326 W. 10th Street, Charlotte NC 28202.</p>

          <h3>Kissing Cousins: Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Constructive Fraud</h3>
          <h4>By: Trey Lindley</h4>
          <p>Breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud are probably the most conflated causes of action in fiduciary litigation. If you can’t readily discern between them, you’re in good company—many practitioners allege them in tandem as a single claim for relief, and a number of opinions from our appellate courts treat them likewise. Breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud are nonetheless dis- tinguishable in two important ways. <br>
          To prevail on a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, the plain- tiff must prove: (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2) a breach of the duty owed, and (3) damages proximately caused by the breach. See Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 749 S.E.2d 262, 268 (2013). Although the elements for constructive fraud have ap- peared in various permutations, a widely accepted articulation is found in White v. Consolidated Planning, Inc., 166 N.C. App. 283, 603 S.E.2d 147 (2004): “To survive a motion to dismiss, a cause of action for constructive fraud must allege (1) a relationship of trust and confidence, (2) that the defendant took advantage of that position of trust in order to benefit himself, and (3) that plain- tiff was, as a result, injured.” Id. at 294, S.E.2d at 156 (citing Sterner v. Penn, 159 N.C. App. 626, 631, 583 S.E.2d 670, 674 (2003))... <a href="#">READ MORE</a></p>

          <h3>On Mandating Trustees’ Duty to Inform and Report</h3>
          <h4>By: Trey Lindley</h4>
          <p>Twenty-three years ago, Clark “CB” Bagby Jr. assumed con- trol of his father’s already successful demolition and grading com- pany and grew it into one of the largest in the Southeast. Only one of his four children showed any promise or passion for the family business, the others content to enjoy its fruits. CB, the sole share- holder of the eponymously named CBDG, Inc., is acutely aware of his need for succession planning and is equally determined to make it as painless for himself as possible. <br>
          “I want them to know I’ve taken care of them, but I don’t want to be pestered about what I gave them, whether it’s enough, or where or how it’s invested. They can fight about that when I’m gone.” <br>
          Among the myriad considerations requiring your counsel, CB wants to relieve the trustee of any reporting obligations for any trusts created for his children’s benefit. What would be your ad- vice? <br> As a threshold matter, you certainly can accomplish CB’s re- quest. The duty to inform and report is a default provision codified in North Carolina’s version of the Uniform Trust Code (“UTC”) at N.C.G.S. Section 36C-8-813. It is limited to qualified beneficiaries and can ordinarily... <a href="#">READ MORE</a></p>
